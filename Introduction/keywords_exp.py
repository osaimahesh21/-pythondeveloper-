# In Python, keywords are reserved words that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers 


#(such as variable names or function names). These keywords are an essential part of the Python language syntax, and they serve specific purposes in the code structure. Here is a list of Python keywords:


# False      class      finally    is         return
# None       continue   for        lambda     try
# True       def        from       nonlocal   while
# and        del        global     not        with
# as         elif       if         or         yield
# assert     else       import     pass
# break      except     in         raise
